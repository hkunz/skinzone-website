## Synopsis

An ActionScript-2 based website i wrote for a friend in 2010

The website doesn't exist anymore but we still have a few pics of it's looks in www.hkunz.com/portfolio/skinzone/

## TODO

Apparently it's broken, SkinZone.fla and SzGraphics.fla are missing, i don't remember if they were generated or accidentally deleted. Something in Build's jsfl is broken too.
